# Welcome to ImagePop

**The program ImagePop.py is no longer being developed and supported by the authors of this paper, Lowell Everest Schudel and Sol Weatherford Courtney, both were students in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Columbia University in New York City New York.**

It is our hope for this program to be openly developed and contributed to by the larger Astronomical society and serve as a simple but useful tool for anyone whom finds him or herself at work under a telescope.
